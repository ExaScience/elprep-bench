This repository contains rudimentary reimplementations of elPrep in C++17 and Java, with the sole purpose to evaluate their runtime performance and memory use. We have used these benchmarks alongside with another reimplementation in Go, and based on the results, settled on Go for the production-ready elPrep version, which you can find in [the main elPrep repository](https://github.com/exascience/elprep "elPrep repository") under an open-source license.
