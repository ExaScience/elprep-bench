**This is not part of the official elPrep repository. If you want to use elPrep in production, please go to [the elPrep repository](https://github.com/exascience/elprep "elPrep repository").**

---

This repository contains a rudimentary reimplementation of elPrep in C++17, with the sole purpose to evaluate its runtime performance and memory use. We have used these benchmarks alongside with reimplementations in Go and Java, and based on the results, settled on Go for the production-ready elPrep version, which you can find in [the main elPrep repository](https://github.com/exascience/elprep "elPrep repository") under an open-source license.
