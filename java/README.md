This repository contains a rudimentary reimplementation of elPrep in Java, with the sole purpose to evaluate its runtime performance and memory use. We have used these benchmarks alongside with reimplementations in C++17 and Go, and based on the results, settled on Go for the production-ready elPrep version, which you can find in [the main elPrep repository](https://github.com/exascience/elprep "elPrep repository") under an open-source license.
